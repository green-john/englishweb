# Google Translate: easy translation or long-term enemy?

We’ve all used Google Translate. Perhaps you’re writing an email to
a multilingual colleague, or in some cases, wandering around a foreign
country in search of a toilet.

In some cases, Google translate might make the cut for an easy translation.
Sure, everyone will know that you’ve used Google, but you’ll likely get
your message across (and hopefully find that toilet!).

However, the last thing you want to do is trust Google translate with
your business. There are endless horror stories of businesses who have
used Google translate to operate; not only can it damage a company’s
reputation, but it shows a lack of attention to detail to your
multilingual clients.

If your
[company’s website doesn’t already have a multi-language option](https://englishweb.eu/en/blog/4-reasons-multilang),
it might be time to consider upgrading. If you do have a multi-language
website, but have yet to fine-tune the translations or don’t know how to
start, this article will walk you through the dos and don’ts of translating.

So, is it ever okay to use Google Translate for your company? Well, the
short answer is rarely.

## When to use Google translate

### 1) Informal content

Simple greetings are often safe territory for Google. Phrases like
“good morning” or “how are you” are incredibly generic and will
likely be translated correctly. However, these are conversational and
informal words. Most international businesses don’t have a demand for
casual content on their website.

### 2) “Middleman” translation

Let’s say your company operates in Germany and is looking to win more
clients by having additional content in English. While your company’s
employees may speak English, they may not be able to translate the
German language content into English and still keep the content’s
meaning. This is where Google can (and has been) used by many
companies.

But the content translation doesn’t stop with Google. Once the content
is translated by Google from German to English, it *must be checked
by a translator or language professional*. The German-speaking company
must collaborate with a translator to work on creating content that
reflects the company and is grammatically correct.

## When not to use Google translate

The truth is, you should never use Google Translate for your business.
While it’s probably going to be reliable for small phrases and
greetings, Google translate is still a piece of technology without
language or cultural experience.

### 1) Marketing your brand

Google Translate won’t take into consideration your brand's voice.
In fact, it can’t. It’s a robot. Your brand is not only how you
market yourself, but it portrays what you do for your clients. If you
translate your website content with Google, chances are that your
Language A speaking readers will be getting a different message than
your Language B speakers.

Let us look at the following sentence example:

It’s important to set professional boundaries with clients to maintain
a good relationship.

In English, this sentence is strong, grammatically correct and gives a
clear message to a website user. However, it is important to note
that an important word in this sentence must be changed to have the
same voice and meaning in, let's say, Spanish. The English to Spanish
translation for the word “boundaries” is “fronteras” or “límites”,
which really just means “borders” or “limits”. There is no word that
exists in Spanish that fully embodies what “boundaries” means in English.

Google Translate won’t know what you’re trying to communicate, and
this will completely throw off your native Spanish speaking clients.

### 2) SEO across languages

It can be difficult to master SEO for website content even in one's
native language, let alone in other languages. SEO is a marketing tool
for your business that helps you get traffic and win clients, so it
should be treated delicately and with care.

While some keywords and phrases may translate well across languages,
that doesn’t always mean they are in equal demand. A big part of a
language is the culture and interests of those speaking the language.
This is something Google cannot understand or practice
(assuming it even translates the original keyword correctly). When it
comes to SEO, it’s best to hire a translation professional to create
multi-language content for your website.

### 3) Language Popularity

Google Translate is even less reliable for languages that are not
as widely spoken as Spanish.
[While 453 million people speak Spanish worldwide](https://www.worlddata.info/languages/index.php),
there are only
[6 million Croatian speakers](https://slavic.ucla.edu/languages/bcs/croatian-background-info/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Croatian%20is%20spoken%20by,in%20the%20U.S.A.%20and%20Canada.).
Google is designed for mass consumption, and Croatian speakers hardly
make up that mass.

*picture here*

If you want to say, “ballpark number/figure” in Croatian (a potentially
very important word on your website), the correct translation would
be: **procjena bez da ste upoznati s detaljima posla.**

Clearly, there is a mishap here. And it’s not a mishap that any business
can afford to have.
[59% of website users in the UK stated they would not use a company with a clear grammar and spelling mistakes on their website](https://realbusiness.co.uk/poor-grammar-on-websites-scares-59-away).
Clients will see poor grammar and language as an example of poor work,
which is likely not the brand you are trying to promote for your
company. Google is a free tool, and the idea of “you get what you pay
for” goes a long way here.

If you want to avoid having poorly translated content on your website,
don’t trust Google (or any online translation tool for that matter). You
need real people with real experience to maintain your company’s voice
and brand, all while guaranteeing error-free and original text.
