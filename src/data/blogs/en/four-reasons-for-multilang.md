It’s no secret that ever since the spring of 2020, business suits and office cubicles have been
traded in for sweatpants and online meetings. The work-from-home transition has taken place
worldwide, and whether we like it or not, it’s here to stay.

This also means that businesses and e-commerce websites are more interconnected than ever before.
In 2020, [more than two billion people](https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/#dossierKeyfigures) 
across the globe purchased goods and services through an online platform. This is more than 25 percent of our
global population. And with an increase of both need and accessibility to laptops and mobile devices,
we can only expect e-commerce statistics to grow exponentially.

Multi-language websites are no longer optional; they’re a necessity. This article will
explore the reasons and benefits as to why you should add language options to your company’s
website, and we’ll even give you tips on how to get started with the process.

### 1) Customer personalization

It’s important for your customers to feel central in your business. When your website is accurately and
professionally translated to have a customer's native language available (and we’re not talking
about turning on the Google translate feature), your audience will undoubtedly feel appreciated
and recognized.

A multi-language website can also help you market to your target audience effectively through both
language and cultural responses appropriate to the region. It shows your own cultural sensitivity
and awareness beyond what is local, and international customers will take note of such detail.

### 2) Increase your audience

When you design your website for advertising products and services, you likely have a target
audience in mind. While it’s important to narrow down and focus on a particular group of
people for advertising, having a mono-language website cuts out an entire population of
potential customers. You can grow your target audience and increase your website traffic
with more than one language available on your website.

### 3) Stand out

As we continue to move in the business world during a global pandemic, companies everywhere
are needing to find unique ways to stand out in the crowd. Having a multilingual
website gives you that oomph, the kind that makes an impression on your customers and will
help you boost your sales internationally. As we move towards a global state of
e-commerce, don’t be afraid to move your website along with it.

### 4) Europeans often speak more than one language…

…and your website should too. In 2016, more than
[35% of working-age adults in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Foreign_language_skills_statistics#Number_of_foreign_languages_known)
reported  speaking at least one foreign language fluently. This shouldn’t be a surprise;
Europe is a continent known for its tourism and business across borders. If your company
is in the EU, having a multi-language website will open up doors for easy business
with other EU member states, increase your sales and expand your client base.

## The next step: Translating your website

Translating your website doesn't need to be difficult or stressful, but it is
more work than simply finding a person who is native in the language. It’s
key to have experienced professionals do the translations, and English Web’s
team is happy to help. We currently offer English, Croatian, Spanish & Polish
languages so that your business can grow and reach all corners of the world.
